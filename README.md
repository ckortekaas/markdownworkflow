Markdown Workflow Testing
================

This is a test site to see if markdown with markdown editors can be a decent alternative to WYSIWYG editors + shortcodes.

Sometimes you just gotta *try* things out to __see__! ~~I once was blind~~

### How to test Markdown workflows:
* try out the formatting
 * See if you like it
 * Share it with others
   * But not too many others 
 * Try out some hyperlinking eg http://www.library.uq.edu.au
 * Add a pretty picture!

 * Commit it back to github
  * Show it on the website
  * Do a pull request from another user
  * Add a comment


You know.. you can just use the github.com editor GUI and it works just fine really
